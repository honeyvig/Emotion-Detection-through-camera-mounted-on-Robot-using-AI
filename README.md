# Emotion-Detection-through-camera-mounted-on-Robot-using-AI
A Python script implementing an AI model to detect fear emotion from a camera mounted on the robot.

A Python script to control the robot’s movement based on the detected fear emotion, stopping or starting it accordingly.

A guide for setting up, deploying, and testing the Python scripts and AI model on the robot system.
--------------
To implement a system that detects fear emotion from a camera mounted on a robot and controls the robot's movement accordingly, we will break it down into the following components:
1. Fear Emotion Detection using AI (Face Emotion Recognition)

For detecting emotions like fear from a camera feed, we can use a pre-trained emotion recognition model that classifies emotions based on facial expressions.
2. Robot Control Based on Emotion Detection

Once the fear emotion is detected, we will write a Python script to control the robot's movement. If fear is detected, we can stop the robot, and if no fear is detected, we can continue with normal movement.
3. Guide for Setting up and Deploying the System

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up the system on the robot and test it.
Required Tools and Libraries:

    OpenCV: For camera capture and video stream processing.
    DeepFace or FER: For emotion detection (based on face expression recognition).
    Python's Robot API: To control the robot (e.g., robot library or pyrobot depending on your robot).
    TensorFlow/PyTorch: For using pre-trained emotion detection models.

1. Emotion Detection from Camera

We'll use the DeepFace library for emotion recognition, which allows emotion detection through facial expression recognition.
Install necessary libraries:

pip install opencv-python deepface

Python script for emotion detection:

import cv2
from deepface import DeepFace

# Initialize camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Loop to continuously get frames
while True:
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    if not ret:
        break

    # Detect emotions using DeepFace
    result = DeepFace.analyze(frame, actions=['emotion'])

    # Extract the dominant emotion
    dominant_emotion = result['dominant_emotion']

    # Display the emotion on the frame
    cv2.putText(frame, dominant_emotion, (50, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)
    
    # Show the frame
    cv2.imshow('Emotion Detection', frame)

    # Check if the detected emotion is 'fear'
    if dominant_emotion == 'fear':
        print("Fear detected!")
        # Insert a condition here to stop the robot or trigger a response

    # Press 'q' to exit the loop
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

2. Robot Control Based on Emotion Detection

Next, we'll write a Python script to control the robot's movement. This script will use a robot API to stop or start the robot based on whether fear is detected.

Here is an example of integrating this with a robot control system. For the purpose of this example, we'll use a placeholder robot API (robot_control_api) that simulates controlling a robot.
Install the robot API library:

pip install pyrobot

Python script for robot control:

from robot_control_api import Robot

# Function to stop robot movement
def stop_robot(robot):
    print("Stopping robot...")
    robot.stop()

# Function to start robot movement
def start_robot(robot):
    print("Starting robot...")
    robot.move_forward()

# Initialize robot control
robot = Robot()

# Initialize camera for emotion detection (reuse previous camera code)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    if not ret:
        break

    # Detect emotions using DeepFace
    result = DeepFace.analyze(frame, actions=['emotion'])
    dominant_emotion = result['dominant_emotion']
    
    # Display the emotion on the frame
    cv2.putText(frame, dominant_emotion, (50, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)
    cv2.imshow('Emotion Detection', frame)

    # If fear emotion is detected, stop the robot
    if dominant_emotion == 'fear':
        stop_robot(robot)
    else:
        start_robot(robot)

    # Exit condition
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

3. Guide for Setting Up, Deploying, and Testing
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

    Install Required Software: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (opencv-python, deepface, robot-control-api).
    Robot API Setup: Ensure the robot control API is properly set up and connected to your robot hardware.
    Camera Setup: Make sure the camera is properly mounted on the robot and accessible to your Python script.
    Python Version: Ensure you are using Python 3.7+.

Step 2: Running the Script

    Test Emotion Detection: Run the script for emotion detection independently first to ensure the camera is properly capturing facial expressions.

python emotion_detection.py

This should display the camera feed and show the detected emotion.

Test Robot Control: Test the robot control by running the script that connects both emotion detection and robot movement control.

    python robot_control_with_emotion.py

    Test the System in a Real-World Scenario:
        Place the robot in a safe environment.
        Ensure the camera is correctly detecting faces and emotions.
        Test the robot’s movement response when the fear emotion is detected.
        Verify that the robot stops or starts based on the emotion detected.

    Fine-tuning and Adjustments:
        You may want to adjust the thresholds for emotion detection or fine-tune the response logic for better robot behavior.
        You can also add additional emotions (e.g., joy, sadness) and map them to different robot actions.

Step 3: Deployment

    Deploy the system on the robot: Once you confirm everything is working, deploy the script on the robot's main processing unit.
    Real-Time Testing: Perform real-time tests with the robot in an environment where fear detection is expected to happen (e.g., a human user interacting with the robot).
    Monitoring: Monitor performance and make adjustments as needed, particularly in terms of robot response times or emotion classification accuracy.

Conclusion

This system uses an AI-driven emotion recognition model to detect fear from a camera mounted on the robot and triggers specific actions (like stopping or starting movement) based on the detected emotion. The provided scripts integrate DeepFace for emotion detection and a robot control API for controlling the robot's movement. You can further customize the system for different emotions or robot behaviors based on the use case.
